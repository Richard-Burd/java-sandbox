## Java Sandbox
This sandbox will form the basis of my upcomming 'Java Illustrated' cheatsheet.

### Installation (Ubuntu)
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Dev Kit (JDK) are required
Reference:

How to Install Java JRE & JDK 14 on Ubuntu 18.04/19.10

1.) $ sudo apt install openjdk-14-jre-headless

2.) $ java -version       <= this checks the version of jre just installed

3.) $ sudo apt install openjdk-14-jdk-headless <= this will take about 5 minutes to install

4.) $ javac -version      <= this checks the version of java compiler just installed

5.) ~/Desktop/dev/3/java-sandbox (master) $ javac hello.java     <= runs a file
