## Java Sandbox
This sandbox will form the basis for my 'Java Illustrated' cheat-sheet; this will be a continuation of the cheat sheet series available [here](https://richard-burd.github.io/portfolio/software#cheat-sheets-for-languages--frameworks)

### Installation (Ubuntu)
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Dev Kit (JDK) are required to get started with Java, I used this [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-18-04).


### Cool Graphics
This workspace is being used to build out a Java cheat sheet using the same formatting as the successful [Python Illustrated Cheat Sheet](https://richard-burd.github.io/python-illustrated/).&nbsp;
